# FAQ

## Why is the translation of a message wrong?

To provide unlimited free translation to the bot, we use less efficient translation models which results in lower quality of translation, to improve the quality of translation, you can [pay for google translation character. ](premium/premium.md)

According to the revenue we generate, we also plan to improve the translation by making our own model.

## Why my message is detected in the wrong language?

The bot supports more than 100 languages, so it must detect all these languages in any message. However, sometimes the message is too short to determine the language or contains too many unwanted elements like emojis or other things. You can increase the minimum size of a message for the language to be detected on the dashboard to reduce the margin of error or ban a language if it is too often confused with another.
