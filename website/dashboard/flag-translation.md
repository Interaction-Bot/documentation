## What does role translation do?

Flag Translation lets user translate a discord message by adding a flag emoji to the message.

## Configure flag translation for a new channel

To translate a new role, you need to click on _**Add a Configuration**_ button.

* _**Channel**_: The channel where the configuration will be applied.

You can see more options by clicking on the _**OPTIONS**_.&#x20;

These options accept different parameters

* _**SENDING MODE:**_ The bot will translate messages differently depending on the selected mode. In "Every time" mode, the bot will send the translation each time a reaction is added to the message. In "Once" mode, the bot will only translate the message if it has never been translated previously by the translation flag and a reaction is added.
* _**AUTO DELETE:**_ If this option is enabled, the translation will be deleted after a delay that changes depending on the length of the message, otherwise the translation will never be deleted.
