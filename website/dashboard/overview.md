# Overview

## Server Overview

The first section lets you obtain some information about your server, like his _**ID**_ that can be used in the status page. You can also localize the cluster that runs the bot on your server.

You can disable the _**simultaneous translation warning**_, this warning informs you when you do too many translations for one message

<details>

<summary>What is <em><strong>simultaneous translation</strong></em>?</summary>

When you type a message and you have configured the bot to translate the message automatically, it will count the number of translations that it does.\
\
For example, if you are in channel #Channel1 and you write _Hello World_, you have configured the bot to translate your message into French, Japanese, and Deutch, the bot will count 3 translations for one message.\
\
If your server is not premium and the bot does more than 3 translations for one message, it will warn you and stop the translation. You need to upgrade to premium to increase this limit. The _**simultaneous translation warning**_ disables the warning of the bot.
